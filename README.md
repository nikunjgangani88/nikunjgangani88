 Myself Nikunj,a full-stack developer building mobile applications and websites for the past 5 years. I have experience in Angular, NodeJs, WordPress, MongoDB, MySQL, Html, and CSS which helps me both on front-end and back-end development.
I always believe in healthy communication. That's the most important thing that will lead to successful projects. I have two important aspects in my work:
<ul>
<li>Write clean and understandable project code with least bugs</li>
<li>Always learning new skills</li>
</ul>
